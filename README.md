My own version of a **to do list using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.**
( published with Github pages at https://mihaiguidea.github.io/ )

The application is build with **local storage**, so whatever your to-do list looks like, when refreshed, it will keep the same list of to-do`s.
Also, the application is build with transition, creating a nice animation once a to-do is deleted. Otherwise, when completed, it crosses a line through the to-do text and increases the to-do opacity.
